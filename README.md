# Advent Of Code 2021

My effort of the [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com) contest

* Programs for 1 December 2021:
  * [day01.cpp](day01.cpp)
  * [day01e.cpp](day01e.cpp)

  After having read that someone wrote their own programming language
  to solve the Advent of Code, it got me thinking about a specification
  language for this kind of puzzles. I wrote [something](https://www.iwriteiam.nl/D2112.html#1)
  about it on my website.

* Programs for 1 December 2021:
  * [day02.cpp](day02.cpp)
  * [day02e.cpp](day02e.cpp)
  
  I had set my alarm at 6 AM [CET] but woke up ten minutes early.
  About 6:03, I was ready to start solving todays puzzles. The second
  one required some debugging using the sample input.
